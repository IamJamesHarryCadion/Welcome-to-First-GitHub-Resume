## About Me
I am James Harry, an aspiring Esports Manager who is commited to create players whose passion is limitless. I am also bound to protect the image of esports to those who see it as only a bet game, because truly, it's not.

###How did I arrived in here?
Well, I am absolutely a passserby, because I am not into games anymore. Before, I used to play a lot but because of the pandemic, I learned to value my time and not just to play games the whole time. 


# Goals
One of my goals is to be the most trusted manager of a certain tea. Because I have read news about the "scandals of Esports and I am not into that. 
Second is about how the Philippines should be an Esports Hub and join the unstoppable growth of esports worldwide.
Third is to create a heavy-duty yet passionable players who are committed to not just play the game by money, but by passion.

2. I am a Live Streamer at Bigo Live wherein I have handled my first ever event of Esports Tournament called " _Pika For Life_"
